# Maze Solver

The Maze Solver is a Python and Tkinter project that draws a randomized maze and then algorithmically solves the maze.

## Requirements

The app requires Python 3 to run. All development and testing was completed using Python `3.11.4`. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

## Running the App

Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory to launch the app:

```shell
% python main.py
```

Exit the app by simply closing the window.

## Tests

A single test was written early in development but broke soon after additional functionality was added. If I return to this project in the future, additional tests will be added and this test fixed.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) for providing most of the learning material used for this project.
